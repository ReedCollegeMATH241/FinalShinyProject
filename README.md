These files include the results of of ambient and maternal atrazine exposure on early amphibian growth and development, as well as a combined data set focusing on days to hatching, and SVL at hatching.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
