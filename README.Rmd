This final project is a shiny app visualtization of thesis data gathered at Reed College 2014-2015. 
These files include the results of of ambient and maternal atrazine exposure on early amphibian growth and development, as well as a combined data set focusing on days to hatching, and SVL at hatching. 

The graph below shows the raw datapoints of SVL plotted againts days to hatching. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggthemes))
ad <- read.csv("atrazinedata.csv", header=TRUE,  stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% tbl_df()
  
ggplot(data=ad, aes(x=DTH, y=SVL)) + 
       geom_point() + 
       scale_x_continuous(name="Days to Hatching") + 
       scale_y_continuous(name="SVL (mm)") +
       theme_bw()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
